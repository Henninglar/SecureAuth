# Secure Authentication Demo


This Python-based demo highlights key security features for user authentication, including advanced password protection with hashing and salting, rate-limiting against brute force attacks, and a timeout mechanism after multiple failed login attempts. It supports Google OAuth for streamlined access and two-factor authentication (2FA) via TOTP for enhanced security. The create_db.py script is included for database setup during structural updates, not needed for regular use.
